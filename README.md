## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- TailWind CSS (CSS FRAMEWORK)
- JavaScript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- CSS Mobile-First

- **Why I have used *tailwind* for this project ?** - As I learned Tailwind a month ago, as a part of the practice I have used Tailwind Framework.

- I have improved myself in understanding javascript more efficiently.

- **How to get the Data of from *.json* file to Javascript Obj.?** -  This is the first time, I worked for JSON data Parsing. So, after digging on Internet I have found some useful stuff, which solved my problems.

```js
// Here I have Used AJAX for JSON Data.

let localData; 
// a Variable where the Array Data, from JSON is stored in;

$.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "./data.json", // Json FIle
    success:function(response) {
       localData = response; // Storing the Json Data;
       jsonExport(); // Function ToDo after fetching Data;
    }
});
/*
Note After Defining the localData = response; we cannot use localdata at Global Level; So, we used a function; from which we can access the JSON Data via localData object.
*/
```
